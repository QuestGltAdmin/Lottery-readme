## **How to win**

Match numbers, **from the left side of your ticket**, to the winning numbers drawn at the end of a Lottery round.

* Matching even just the first number will win you a small prize.&#x20;
* Match more numbers to win a share of a larger prize pool.

## **‚Äå**Prize eligibility

‚ÄåThere are a total of six lottery balls, from 0 to 9, on each ticket. To win, your numbers need to match the drawn numbers in the same order as the lottery balls, starting from the left of the ticket. For example:

In the example above, Ticket A, The first 4 digits match and the last 2 digits doesn‚Äôt match.

However, since the fifth and sixth digit does **not** match the drawn number, only the first Four digits count as matching in order. This would win a "Match first 4" prize.

<!-- ![Your Ticket B](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (149).png>) -->
Example Ticket B. Here's an lucky one. All the 6 digits match,so this ticket win a ‚ÄúMatch first 6‚Äù prize.


You will only share in prizes from the highest prize bracket you are eligible for. A ticket matching the first three numbers will only be eligible for prizes from the match-three bracket, and not for the match-one or match-two brackets.

**Remember: The digits must match in order, starting from left to right.**

## Prize sharing across prize brackets

‚ÄåAfter a round is drawn, and tickets with matching numbers are determined, the prizes are awarded. The amount won by each ticket will depend on how many other tickets won in the same prize bracket.

‚ÄåFor example, if you have the only ticket that matched three numbers in order, and the predetermined share of the prize pool for your bracket was 2000 BUSD, you'll receive the full 2000 BUSD.

‚ÄåIf, however, you and three other people match three numbers in order, the 2000 BUSD would be split between the four winning tickets, meaning you would receive 500 BUSD.
